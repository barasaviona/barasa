Hello!from sowcoders
stainless steal is a method that i have decided to come up with since plastic pipes have been causing losses to most of the industries since they leaks easly,my main mission is to ensure that all the communities
is to ensure that the whole country is being supplied with enough water by the use of metallic pipes.Since i have got 10.34% equity where by i acqured from my own savings. My business will be located at Nairobi
</p>
this problem has affected the community socially since it has caused effect to human health as bilions of people lack access to water
and has lead to poor water sanitation on communities making communities to have low population growthrate though other people are aware of the problem but they lack financess
<br>
my product exists because the nation recqures metalic pipes which are durable they are resistance to corosion easly maleable  they can be recycled and its cost is efficient<br>my vission
is to ensure that i repair all leaking pipes and maintain water channels hence i wouid have my own company so as to solve this problem since its affecting the whole Nation as i look forward  to ensure that i am getting better methods of carying out ths service<br>this product will help in reducing death rates
because of using  contaminated water as it helps the community at large <br>this would make the community better because of its durability and it reduces rust through galvanization hence making ythe community prodoctive and better
and i would ensure that i would supply to the government for mnore profits since i would be reducing regional conflicts amongest the people .
